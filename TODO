1. Work on hashing password when a new user is created

- firstly import = from passlib.context import CryptContext
- then create a CryptContext object = bcrypt_context = CryptContext(schemes=['bcrypt'], deprecated='auto')
- then use the bcrypt_context to hash the password = hashed_password = bcrypt_context.hash(user.password)

THINGS TO LOOK AT

- Look into Docker
- Look into cloud azure ?

NEEDS WORK / TODO

- Work on putting in a user ID and returning all bills and subscriptions for the.
  (Maybe add this to the User routes / CRUD)
- Maybe start work on Authentication for a User
- Work on making sure notes are clear for anyone that might read this codebase.
