1. Work on hashing password when a new user is created

- firstly import = from passlib.context import CryptContext
- then create a CryptContext object = bcrypt_context = CryptContext(schemes=['bcrypt'], deprecated='auto')
- then use the bcrypt_context to hash the password = hashed_password = bcrypt_context.hash(user.password)

THINGS TO LOOK AT

- Look into Docker
- Look into cloud azure ?

NEEDS WORK / TODO

- Work on making sure notes are clear for anyone that might read this codebase.
- Make a file to keep sensitive info secret for me.

WHERE I LEFT OFF

- create auth_crud and auth_routes for dealing with Authentication.
- Work on unit tests

LEFT OFF

- Created and moved functions to auth_crud() from users_crud
- Work on making changes to user_routes and move endpoints to auth_routes to match crud.
