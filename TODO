1. Work on hashing password when a new user is created

- firstly import = from passlib.context import CryptContext
- then create a CryptContext object = bcrypt_context = CryptContext(schemes=['bcrypt'], deprecated='auto')
- then use the bcrypt_context to hash the password = hashed_password = bcrypt_context.hash(user.password)

THINGS TO LOOK AT

- Look into Docker
- Look into cloud azure ?

NEEDS WORK / TODO

- Make sure to go in Test utils and change the payments
- amount should be amount = 18 not amount = '18'

wrong format..... Look into changing payments in utils test_user.
