1. Work on hashing password when a new user is created

- firstly import = from passlib.context import CryptContext
- then create a CryptContext object = bcrypt_context = CryptContext(schemes=['bcrypt'], deprecated='auto')
- then use the bcrypt_context to hash the password = hashed_password = bcrypt_context.hash(user.password)

THINGS TO LOOK AT

- Look into Docker
- Look into cloud azure ?

NEEDS WORK / TODO

- test get bill by id is not working, as bill id is not generated in the utils fixture.

- Adapt test user payments to create and id for bills and subscriptions for testing.
