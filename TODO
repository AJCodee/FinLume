List of things that I need to work on:

Normalize routes to REST + lowercase; add /api/v1.

Switch routes to sync (short-term) or move DB to async (better).

Move validation into Pydantic; delete _validate_\*.

Add ownership checks to all bill reads/updates/deletes.

Introduce domain exceptions + handlers.

Add pagination to GET /bills.

Add .gitignore, pyproject.toml (black, ruff, isort, mypy), and CI.

Write tests for bills CRUD + auth.

Rename Bills â†’ Bill; tidy modules: schemas/bill.py, repositories/bill.py, services/bill.py.

Create .env.example, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and a clear README.
